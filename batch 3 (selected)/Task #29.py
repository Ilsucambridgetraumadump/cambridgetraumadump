#Task # 29 : Your program should generate a random number between 1 to 20. Now let the user  
#guess this number but only allow 3 tries. Your program must not use a loop( O Level Students). 
#Each time if the user guesses a number greater than the original one print 
#"Too High" or if is smaller print "Too Low!" otherwise if it is equal print "Bingo!" 
#If the user is done with 3 wrong attempts then print "You loose".
